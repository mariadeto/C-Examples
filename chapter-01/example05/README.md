# 🌟 Integer to Double Conversion Program in C++

This program demonstrates basic C++ syntax, including variable declaration, type casting from integer to double, and output operations.

## 📝 Program Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;

int main(void)
{
    int x = 3; // Declare and initialize an integer variable

    // Display the original integer value
    cout << "To x einai " << x << endl;

    // Display the value of x casted to a double
    cout << "To (double)x mas dinei " << (double)x << endl;

    // Confirm that the value of x remains unchanged
    cout << "To x omws den allaxe. Paramenei " << x << endl;

    // Pause the system to view the output before the console closes
    system("pause"); // Note: This is system-specific and not recommended for portability
    
    return 0;
}
```

## 🧐 Explanation of the Code

### 📚 Including the Libraries
- `#include <iostream>` and `#include <cstdlib>`:
  - 🔍 **What is it?** These lines include the iostream and cstdlib libraries.
  - 📈 **Why it's important?** iostream is essential for input and output operations, and cstdlib is used for system commands in C++.

### 🚀 Main Function
- `int main() { ... }`:
  - 🔍 **What is it?** Defines the main function of the program.
  - 📈 **Why it's important?** In C++, program execution starts with the main function. It is of type int, indicating that it returns an integer.

### 🔢 Integer to Double Conversion
- `cout << "To x einai " << x << endl;`:
  - 🔍 **What is it?** Outputs the original integer value of x.
- `cout << "To (double)x mas dinei " << (double)x << endl;`:
  - 🔍 **What is it?** Demonstrates type casting by converting x to a double.
- `cout << "To x omws den allaxe. Paramenei " << x << endl;`:
  - 🔍 **What is it?** Shows that the original value of x remains unchanged after casting.

### 🛑 System Pause
- `system("pause");`:
  - 🔍 **What is it?** Pauses the program execution.
  - 📈 **Why it's important?** Allows the user to see the output before the console window closes. Note: This is Windows-specific and not recommended for portable code.

### ✅ Return Statement
- `return 0;`:
  - 🔍 **What is it?** The last line of the main function.
  - 📈 **Why it's important?** Returning 0 signifies successful execution.

## 🎉 Conclusion
- 🌐 **What happens?** When executed, this program demonstrates the conversion of an integer to a double in C++ and shows the output of both the original and converted values.
- 🔑 **Key Takeaway:** Introduces basic type conversion concepts in C++ and underscores the immutability of variables during type casting.
